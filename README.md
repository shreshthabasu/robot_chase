# robot_chase
A robot "the chaser" chases another robot "the runner"

A graphical interface is created to visualize the runner and chaser on a map. The runner performs a random walk whereas the chaser intelligently picks its action at every time step based on the runner's current position using a recursive tree search.
In every simulation, the runner can be placed on any valid point on the map as chosen by user. THe simulation ends once the chaser cathces the runner.
